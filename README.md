# csci-580-knapsack

this repo contains some test files for your genetic algorithm implementation of knapsack problem
each file consists of:

- num of items
- weight limit
- for each item: weight value

# Knapsack Problem Description

Write a program which attempts to find the best solution to the knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm.

I have provided several test cases in GitHub for this assignment. Also gave you createdata.py so you can create some of your own test files.  

This requires that i know which language(s) my students will use. I will ask in class. 

After your solution is submitted, I will send you a list of questions concerning your code. This will be part of the assignment grade. 

Submit to this blackboard assignment a detailed description of your solution and how you came up with it and lessons you've learned about genetic algorithms and NP-complete problems.
